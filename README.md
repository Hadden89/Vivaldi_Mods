## About Vivaldi Browser
What is Vivaldi? A [new browser](https://vivaldi.com) launched several years ago based on Chromium/Blink - which is actually a great engine - to be the spirtual successor of Opera [Presto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_(browser_engine)) which original development was halted after the acquistion of the company. Why is cool? Where ALL the browser now tends to look alike the same and oversimplified - Vivaldi point to be unique, user-centric and has a great support from its developers and community users.

In this small repo I'll list the mods I currently use on Vivaldi Browser but before doing anything please READ the [help](https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi?page=1) guide.

## About CSS 
The code is usually updated on Vivaldi Snapshot when it reaches [Release Candidate](https://forum.vivaldi.net/search?term=RC&in=titles&matchWords=all&categories%5B%5D=83&sortBy=topic.timestamp&sortDirection=desc&showAs=topics) status (RC) so it should work with latest [Vivaldi Stable](https://vivaldi.com/download/) too.

Few lines are actually tailored around my Vivaldi installation but most code should work with any setup vivaldi installation. Only pick the code you actually need. If in doubt, ask to the great [modding community](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) for help.

For this version, I merged again the code into a single CSS but is still divided in sub-sections with comment lines. Hope is quite clear :)

## What about JS mods ?
For JS mods you should [check or ask](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) in the modification thread. I used to have a list here but is quite [outdated](https://github.com/Hadden89/Vivaldi_mods/blob/master/Javascript_mods.md).

By the way, enjoy vivaldi and its community. [Join to the forum](https://forum.vivaldi.net) if you didn't that yet ;)
